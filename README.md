# Recurrent-Neural-networks

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence.

LSTM - 
The Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, network is a type of Recurrent Neural
Network, or RNN, specially designed for sequence problems. The promise of RNNs,
and LSTMs in particular, is that the temporal dependence and contextual information
in the input data can be learned!
